# DAO
A DAO for funding open source software development: Many open source projects rely on donations or sponsorships to fund their development. A DAO could allow the community to collectively decide which projects to fund, and then automatically distribute the funds to the developers as they complete milestones.

A DAO for managing a community-owned renewable energy project: A DAO could be used to manage a renewable energy project that is owned and operated by the community. Members of the community could propose projects (e.g. installing solar panels on a local school), and then the DAO could vote on which projects to fund. The revenue generated from the project could be used to fund future projects or to pay dividends to the community.

A DAO for organizing community clean-up efforts: A DAO could be used to organize and fund community clean-up efforts, such as beach clean-ups or park clean-ups. Members of the community could propose clean-up projects, and then the DAO could vote on which projects to fund. The DAO could also track the progress of the clean-up efforts and report back to the community.
